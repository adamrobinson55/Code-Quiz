# Code-Quiz

## Project Description

    This is a general use quiz site, it uses mainly javascript to generate questions from a pool in order. By editing the questionList array the quiz could potentially be about anything. I am using HTML to set up a series of hidden elements that are display when a function calls them. The CSS is used to make the site a little more pleasing to look at and a little responsiveness to quiz itself.

## Table of Contents

    I am adding this section to memorize basic READMEs, despite that it's not required for this.

## How to Install and Run

    This section is also being added for memorization.

## How to use

    This site featues a landing menu that prompts the user to either press the "Begin Quiz" button or press Highscores to view highscores. If the user presses "Begin Quiz" a timer will begin and they will be prompted with a series of questions, if they get a question wrong 10 seconds will be removed from the timer, at the end of the quiz an input box and submission button will appear, text at the top will tell the user the their score. The submission will be stored as an array and then turned into a string and sent to local storage. At this point highscores will be displayed, this also would be displayed if highscores was pressed at the begining, a list of all scores is generated. In the top left where the high scores button was the word "menu" now appears pressing this will reload the page and restart the quiz prompts.
